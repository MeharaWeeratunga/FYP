# Project Breakdown: Early Prediction of Research Paper Virality in CS

## Research Gaps Analysis

### 1. Timeline Prediction Gap
- **Current State**: Methods require 3+ years of citation data
- **Gap**: No effective prediction within 30-90 days
- **Impact**: Makes systems impractical for real-world use

### 2. Multi-Modal Integration Gap
- **Current State**: Single-modality approaches only
- **Gap**: No sophisticated fusion of multiple data sources
- **Impact**: Missing cross-modal predictive relationships

### 3. CS-Domain Specialization Gap
- **Current State**: General-purpose methods for all fields
- **Gap**: CS-specific characteristics ignored
- **Impact**: Suboptimal performance on CS papers

## Technical Innovation Areas

### 1. Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion
- Dynamic weighting based on data availability/quality
- Cross-modal attention mechanisms
- Expected: >6.4% AUC improvement

### 2. Temporal-Aware Graph Neural Networks
